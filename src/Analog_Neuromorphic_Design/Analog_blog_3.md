## Simulation

# Putting code on your design
To run simulation we must add code to our schematic design,
this can be either witha  code block or a code shown block. 
code blocks look liket wo sheets of paper stacked and code shown blocks
actually show the code openly on the simulator

To validate the behavior of this amplifier, proceed to the Analog Primitives Validation area of the GoogleSkywater design platform. There, you can use SPICE simulations to analyze the performance of your circuit under different conditions. It's essential to check for parameters like gain, bandwidth, and power consumption to ensure the amplifier meets the required specifications.

3. **Run Simulations**: Execute the simulation scripts, focusing on DC, AC, and transient analyses. Look for any discrepancies in the expected output and refine the design as needed.
4. **Validation**: Once the simulations yield satisfactory results, validate the design through the GoogleSkywater toolkit to ensure it meets all technological and operational standards.
